# QRcodeFunctionality_Swift

The project is about building a Screen for an iPhone app that can search for an item in two ways: by inputing the number neccessary in the required field
or by scanning a QR code to do the same task. 

The scanning surface is built inside the same viewcontroller and occupies only a portion of the screen. 
The result of the scanning is shown on the section below.

-This requires to build a containerViewController that will behave as the ChildViewController of the the ViewController which holds both ways of searching. 
-Additional features will be added for study purpose.
